## Abstract

Neural Denoiser is a class of machine learning algorithms that use supervised learning to reduce noise in images or videos. A light transport technique with low sampling is used in the visual effects industry to reconstruct image sequences. Denoising an image has been a classic problem for decades, and neural networks have been helpful to the field as they have developed rapidly. They can, however, be used only in limited instances due to the difficulty in obtaining large quantities of noisy-clean image pairs for supervision. There are many sources of noise that complicate image denoising such as Gaussian, impulse, salt, pepper, and speckle noises. In the past, multiple attempts have been made to train image-denoising models with noisy images, but these approaches failed due to inefficient network training, loss of information, or reliance on noise modeling. The purpose of this report is to develop a supervised algorithm that aims to eliminate image noise. This model will be trained using the Smartphone Image Denoising Dataset (SIDD) and RENOIR which both combined contain over thousand noisy images captured under different lighting conditions with different cameras. In addition, I will explain my approach from a theoretical perspective and provides appropriate examples to further validate it.
